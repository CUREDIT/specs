# Research and Development Projects

These are based on **dual** categories in connected planar embeddings and points & tries based quadtrees or k-D trees. For instance we have discretely continous and continuously discrete data points. We also have both a countably infinite and an uncountably finite object. These objects and their morphisms form (dual) categories, f-algebras, wiring diagrams, string diagrams, petri-nets and hypergraphs, depending on the context. These are stato-dynamic and dynamically-static systems where the data is both lazily infinite and eagerly finite at the same time. Hence it can self-host itself in either the memory, cpu-cache, network-end-2-end-cache or some secondary storages.

Examples:

1. A collaborative editing platform as a plugin for existing platforms.
2. Project progress tracking and reviewing.
3. Automation of project communication.
4. Project management and community building.

## Buckets and Pages

Constant time retrieval of theoretically infinite-sized directories will be achieved using space-filling curves on planar pages. Any page can be trivially converted into a hypergraph. Path compressed, binary divided, balanced box decomposed, conjugable, and sliding middles with n-D orderings and hB AG/LSD trees with recursive partitioning are allowed on the pages.

## Queries and DSLs

Constant time retrieval of directories and files of pages of data requires natural language query extensions with a simple boolean and/or bayesian logic embedded in it. These should allow for point and range (line) based retrievals. Grid files, EXCELL, MDEH, LHPE, PLOP Hashing, Linear Hashing, Dynamic Z Hashing, Quantile Hashing, Spiral Hashing and PK-trees are respectfully admissible in the queries and the DSLs as native and first class citizens for all kinds of queries but especially those based on features or relational locations.

## Planar topological spaces

These spaces contain value objects or records as atomic entries. These are usually represented with unit sized cells. The cell shapes, tilings and tesellations are dependent on the underlying plane and overarching composition rules. The ordering spaces should be of low computational and storage complexity themselves. This is easily achievable if a disciplined and rigorous implementation of various space-filling curves are iteratively applied on the space or plane, as suggested above.

### Celluloid and Toroid spaces

These spaces contain grid cells on a plane and torus, neither of which are allowed be moebius-like. Medial Axis Transformation, Minkowski distance metrics, runlength encoding, chain codes, irregular grids, region quadtrees and region octtrees, sector trees, strip trees, arc trees, BSP Trees, BSPR Trees, Prism Trees, HAL Trees, Atrees, Bintrees, X-Y Trees, Puzzletrees, Hexagonal/Triangular/Non-orthogonal tesselations, K-structures, triangulations, decompositions, separating chains, layered dags, coverage/density-based splits, hierarchical pyramids, R-trees, bounding box hierarchies, R\*/R+/Cell/kDB-Trees, Lath data structures for manifold objects and meshes with boundaries, Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay graphs/ triangulations/ tetrahedralizatons, line/edge/vertex/MX/face/PM/PMR quad/oct trees, adaptively sampled distance fields are respectfully admissible in the queries and the DSLs as native and first class citizens for all kinds of storages but especially those based on constructive (non)solid/graphical/projective/categorical constructive geometry features or relational locations.

### Helical and Spiral spaces

These spaces contain grid cells on a plane and torus, both of which are allowed to be moebius-like. Plane sweeps, intersections, segments, intervals, priority, COUNT, measure theory constructs, corner stitching, grid files, LSD trees, MX-CIF Quad/Octtree, spatial join queries, similarity retrieval, k-nearest, k-farthest, probably-approximately-correct nearest neighbors, skylines, clustering, pruning, ordering, processing, X/P/SR-trees, Approximate Voronoi Diagrams, pyramids, ball partitioning, Vp/Vpsb/Mvp/Gh-trees, Geometric Nearest NATs, Bisector trees, Mb-trees, kNN graphs, approximating and eliminating search algorithms, distance matrix methods, indexing without triangle inequality, dimension reduced spaces, Lipschitz Embeddings, reference sets, fastmaps, and b-trees are respectfully admissible in the queries and the DSLs as native and first class citizens for all kinds of morphisms but especially those based on constructive (non)solid/graphical/projective/categorical constructive geometry features or relational locations.
