# Research and Development Projects

These are based on dual categories in connected planar embeddings and tries. For instance we have discretely continous and continuously discrete data points. We also have countable infinite and uncontably infinite objects. These objects and their morphisms form categories, f-algebras, wiring diagrams, string diagrams and hypergraphs. These are stato-dynamic and dynamically-static systems where the data is both lazily infinite and eagerly finite at the same time. Hence it can self-host itself in either the memory, cpu-cache, network-cache or some secondary storages.

## Buckets and Pages

Constant time retrieval of theoretically infinite-sized directories filling space-filling curves on pages. Any page can be trivially converted into a hypergraph.

## Queries and DSLs

Constant time retrieval of directories and files of pages of data requires natural language query extensions with a simple boolean and/or bayesian logic embedded in it. These should allow for point and range (line) based retrievals.

## Planar topological spaces

These spaces contain value objects or records as atomic entries.

### Celluloid and Toroid spaces

These spaces contain grid cells on a plane and torus, both of which are not allowed be moebius-like.

### Helical and Spiral spaces

These spaces contain grid cells on a plane and torus, both of which are allowed be moebius-like.
