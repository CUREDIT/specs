# Entry of the client

When the client enters the domain, the domain system should be able to respond reactively.

1. Responsiveness
2. Resilience
3. Elasticity
4. Messaging-Oriented

Responsiveness in most cases requires asking a certain question and responding with a form to fill up in the first run.

Next up is clarifying the cost and benefit implications candidly and visually.

After an agreement at this state we can move towards confirming the paymennt and transaction proof.

There are multiple possible states to move on to after this. Therefore we should perhaps strive to describe it via a state diagram.
